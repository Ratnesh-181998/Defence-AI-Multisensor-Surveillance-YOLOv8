Interview-Ready Summary of the Role

This role focuses on building defence-grade, real-time AI systems for object detection, tracking, and visibility enhancement using Day + Thermal cameras on Jetson Orin hardware. The work is fully hands-on and deployed in real defence field environments.

How I would explain the work in an interview
1. Building Real-Time AI Systems

I will be responsible for developing real-time object classification and tracking pipelines with strict latency requirements (under 500 ms).
This includes optimizing models using TensorRT, ONNX, and Jetson-specific acceleration.

2. Visibility Enhancement (Drishyak)

I will work on an AI-based visibility enhancement module for fog, smoke, low light, using
techniques like CLAHE, local tone mapping, and deep-learning-based enhancement.

3. Multi-Camera, Multi-Sensor Integration

The system involves 4× GigE cameras (Day + IR).
I will design synchronized multi-camera pipelines, sensor fusion, and 24×7 stable inference.

4. Full Training Pipeline

I'm expected to build end-to-end:

Dataset creation & annotation workflows

Training pipelines for YOLO/Detectron/Transformer models

Synthetic dataset generation for IR/thermal scenarios

mAP tuning, augmentation, and class balancing

5. Tracking & Kinematics

I will implement tracking using SORT / DeepSORT / CentroidTracker and integrate
motion & kinematics logic for:

Azimuth / elevation calculations

Angular velocity

Pixel ↔ degree mapping

Trajectory estimation

6. Embedded & Real-Time Constraints

I will deploy everything on Jetson Orin AGX, optimized for:

Low latency

Power efficiency

Continuous operation in field conditions

Some CUDA optimization knowledge is a bonus.

7. Defence-Grade Documentation

I’ll follow a DO-178C style documentation process:

SRS, SDD

Test plans

Acceptance test procedures

Field trial reports

8. Field Trials

This role includes on-site testing and reviews with defence teams, evaluating model performance in real-world conditions.
