I've created the Streamlit project scaffold as a single-file app: Defence Ai Streamlit Project/app.
Open the canvas (left panel) to view, edit, and download the complete app.py.

What I included:

End-to-end scaffold (dataset helpers, augmentation, visibility enhancement, tracker, training/inference stubs, multi-camera worker, TensorRT/ONNX stubs)

Streamlit UI with controls for streams, model upload, training/export stubs, system health, live frames, logs and download snapshot.

DO-178C-style docs generator stub (SRS JSON).

Clear comments and instructions at the top for running locally and extending to Jetson.

Next steps you can ask for (I can do immediately):

Split this single-file scaffold into a GitHub-ready repo with modules (/src, /models, /docs) and a requirements.txt, README.md, and example videos.

Add a working YOLOv8 training pipeline using ultralytics, with sample dataset creation + training script.

Integrate a real DeepSORT implementation and provide tested unit examples.

Add GPU/TensorRT conversion scripts that run on Jetson Orin (with trtexec examples).

Improve the UI: add telemetry charts, exportable logs, and operator control (start/stop per-camera).

Create a polished README.md and license, plus CI (GitHub Actions) for linting and tests.

Tell me which next step you want and I’ll update the project files directly.
