elow is a complete, interview-ready “Project Explanation” you can use when the interviewer asks:

“Explain a project you built that’s relevant to this role.”
or
“Walk me through an end-to-end defence-grade AI system you would build.”

This version matches the job description exactly and makes you sound fully aligned with the role.

✅ Interview-Ready Defence AI Project (End-to-End Build)

Project Title: Real-Time Multi-Sensor Object Detection, Tracking & Visibility Enhancement System on Jetson Orin

1. Problem Statement

Design and deploy a real-time, defence-grade AI system that performs:

Object detection (Day + Thermal camera)

Real-time tracking with motion/kinematics

3. Dataset Pipeline (End-to-End)
a. Collecting data

Recorded day + IR frames in multiple field environments:
fog, smoke, low light, moving vehicle, static camera

Captured synchronization metadata (timestamps, IMU, GPS).

b. Annotation workflow

Built custom annotation tool (CVAT label filters + YOLO export)

Created separate label schemas for Day vs IR

Ensured frame alignment for multi-camera samples

c. Synthetic Data Generation

Used procedural fog, smoke, Gaussian noise, IR-style grayscale simulation

Domain randomization for:
brightness, temperature patterns, glare, occlusion

d. Augmentation

Mosaic, MixUp

Thermal-specific augmentations (heat signature bloom, blur)

Motion blur, perspective shift, low contrast, CLAHE variants

4. Model Training
Models used

YOLOv8m & YOLOv8n (Day + Thermal)

Detectron2 Faster RCNN for thermal accuracy benchmarking

Vision Transformers explored for long-range detection

Training focus

mAP optimization

Class balancing & weighting

FP16 training + quantization-aware training (INT8-ready)

5. Model Optimization for Jetson Orin
ONNX → TensorRT Pipeline

Exported YOLO → ONNX → TensorRT engine

GStreamer + DeepStream integration

Asynchronous inference queues

6. Real-Time Tracking + Kinematics

Integrated DeepSORT with thermal + day-camera fused detections.

Implemented kinematics logic:

Azimuth / elevation from pixel coordinates

Angular velocity estimation

Pixel ↔ degree mapping using camera intrinsics

Short-term trajectory prediction for moving objects

ID persistence in occlusion, fog, and thermal noise

7. Visibility Enhancement (Drishyak Module)
Algorithms Implemented

CLAHE-based contrast enhancement

Local DRC (dynamic range compression)

Smoke/fog removal via:

Dark channel prior

CNN-based enhancement

Fusion of enhanced Day + Thermal for final display

Output: 25–30 FPS visibility improved video feed.

8. Multi-Camera, Multi-Sensor Fusion

Time-synchronized 4 streams

Calibration:
extrinsic + intrinsic for Day–IR alignment

Fusion logic for:

Confidence-weighted detection

IR fallback during zero-visibility

Combined tracking outputs

9. Real-Time Operator UI

Built a PyQt / Web-based UI for the operator.

Features:

Live Day + Thermal feed

Detection overlays

System health metrics (CPU, GPU, memory, temp)

Logging, alerts & status events

Camera switching and zoom control

10. Defence-Grade Documentation (DO-178C Inspired)

Delivered:

SRS – System requirements

SDD – Software design

STP – Test plan

ATP – Acceptance test procedures

FTR – Field Trial Report

Focus on traceability matrix + failure mode documentation.

11. Field Trials & Validation

Conducted trials in:

Fog conditions

Low-light areas

High-thermal noise areas

Moving vehicle platform

Collected:

Latency metrics

Accuracy in real-world scenarios

Thermal-camera robustness testing

Final system successfully met the <500 ms latency and 24×7 stability requirement.
